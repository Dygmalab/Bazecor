# Focus API documentation

## Concept

The Focus API is a two-way communication mechanism between the Raise and any computer software that wants to get information or configure/activate the raise\'s plugins.

It discovers all the EEPROM assigned positions of the memory with specific commands to update or trigger them depending on the kind of plugin that uses them.

This means for example being capable of storing the macros or to be able to trigger them through the serial interface without touching the keyboard or Bazecor.

The focus library is a part of the Keyboard's Firmware but also has a helper class created in JavaScript for the Bazecor, we will show here the commands for the JavaScript Focus API and how to trigger them through the serial interface also, just as an example if you want to retrieve all available commands you have to send the keyboard the string "help".

**For JavaScript:** `focus.command("help")`

**Serial Command (Unix):** `echo 'help' > /dev/ttyACM0`

The serial interface will always end the current message by a newline feed plus a period.

You can expand on this knowledge in the docs about the [kaleidoscope Firmware](https://kaleidoscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) from which the Raise extends

## ⚠ Memory usage disclaimer ⚠

When sending focus commands to the keyboard, keep in mind that every time you put data after the command, that stores the information in the keyboard, this means that the flash memory is using up it's lifespan, so avoid loops that save data to the keyboard frequently, so that the chip will last you as long as possible.

### version

Returns the version of the Raise firmware stored in the keyboard's EEPROM

#### Commands

JavaScript: `focus.command("version")`
Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'version' > /dev/ttyACM0`

#### Expected output

it should give back 3 strings,

- Bazecor Version:
- `v0.2.5`
- Kaleidoscope's newest Git commit incorporated
- `6bd1f81e`
- Raise's Firmware newest Git commit
- `fe423ce-dirty`
- Dirty here means it was custom-built with the makefile, not built automatically by Travis.

### keymap.custom

This command of the focus API has two functions, when sent alone, it retrieves the whole custom keymap stored in the keyboard, when sent with the map as trailing numbers (in the same format as received) it will update the custom keymap stored in the EEPROM.

To know the actual correlation between the position of the map sent and the actual keys in the keyboard, [look here](https://github.com/Dygmalab/Raise-Firmware/blob/master/FOCUS_API.MD)

Being `N N N...` the 16bit numbers that represent each key assigned to that position of the keymap the numbers amount 80(keys per layer)x10(custom layers)

#### Expected output

It should give back the whole custom keymap (80 key positions for each layer and all 10 layers) if sent alone, if sent with the keymap of the same length as received, it should return a nextline, period.

### keymap.default

This command works in the same way as keymap.custom, but affecting the default layers stored in the -1 and -2 positions of the layer stack.

### macros.map

This command reads/writes the macros map (2048 bytes of max lenght), each action in a macro is composed of an action type and a key attached to it.

- MACRO_ACTION_END = 0
  - Ends the current macro play sequence, it's used at the end of a macro to separate it from the second
  - Example: " 0 "
  - Total cost = 1
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_INTERVAL = 1
  - Changes the reproduction interval between each key of the sequence when a tap sequence or a tap code sequence (12 or 13) are used
  - The step uses a 16bit integer splitted into two 8bit numbers to send it to the keyboard, first comes the higher weight
  - Example: " 1 1 44 " for a 300ms delay
  - Total cost = 3
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_WAIT = 2
  - Custom delay that lets the macro wait for any event before continuing the sequence.
  - The step uses a 16bit integer splitted into two 8bit numbers to send it to the keyboard, first comes the higher weight
  - Example: " 2 1 44 " for a 300ms delay
  - Total cost = 3
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_KEYDOWN = 3
  - Activates the keydown event for a KeyCode defined by two 8bit numbers, the higher weight carries the flags, the lower weight carries the code.
  - The step uses a 16bit integer that identifies any key, splitted into two 8bit numbers to send it to the keyboard. First comes the higher weight.
  - Example: " 3 76 226 " for the keyCode 19682, which activates the keydown action for the Media.Mute button.
  - Total cost = 3
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_KEYUP = 4
  - Activates the keyup event for a KeyCode defined by two 8bit numbers, the higher weight carries the flags, the lower weight carries the code.
  - The step uses a 16bit integer that identifies any key, splitted into two 8bit numbers to send it to the keyboard. First comes the higher weight.
  - Example: " 4 76 226 " for the keyCode 19682, which activates the keyup action for the Media.Mute button.
  - Total cost = 3
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_TAP = 5
  - Activates the tap event for a KeyCode defined by two 8bit numbers, the higher weight carries the flags, the lower weight carries the code.
  - The step uses a 16bit integer that identifies any key, splitted into two 8bit numbers to send it to the keyboard. First comes the higher weight.
  - Example: " 5 76 226 " for the keyCode 19682, which activates the tap action for the Media.Mute button.
  - Total cost = 3
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_KEYCODEDOWN = 6
  - Activates the keydown event for a KeyCode defined by one 8bit number, it only carries the code up to 255, which means only normal keys can be sent this way.
  - The step uses a lone 8bit number to identify any key < 256, as no flags are sent, 0 is used for the flag identifier instead.
  - Example: " 6 225 " for the keyCode 225, which activates the keydown action for the Right Shift button.
  - Total cost = 2
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_KEYCODEUP = 7
  - Activates the keyup event for a KeyCode defined by one 8bit number, it only carries the code up to 255, which means only normal keys can be sent this way.
  - The step uses a lone 8bit number to identify any key < 256, as no flags are sent, 0 is used for the flag identifier instead.
  - Example: " 7 225 " for the keyCode 225, which activates the keyup action for the Right Shift button.
  - Total cost = 2
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_TAPCODE = 8
  - Activates the tap event for a KeyCode defined by one 8bit number, it only carries the code up to 255, which means only normal keys can be sent this way.
  - The step uses a lone 8bit number to identify any key < 256, as no flags are sent, 0 is used for the flag identifier instead.
  - Example: " 8 225 " for the keyCode 225, which activates the tap action for the Right Shift button.
  - Total cost = 2
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_EXPLICIT_REPORT = 9
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_IMPLICIT_REPORT = 10
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_SEND_REPORT = 11
  - The functions 9,10,11 are not implemented in the newer versions of the keyboard, they are no longer needed as there is no reason to change the way the report is sent to the host PC.
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_TAP_SEQUENCE = 12
- MACRO_ACTION_STEP_TAP_CODE_SEQUENCE = 13
  - The functions 12 & 13 behave in the same way, 13 should allow the flag sending for the block, but this introduces a double zero which will make the whole macro sequence unreadable, so this has to change to be able to work.
  - Activates the tap event for a sequence of KeyCodes (which will be reproduced as a number of taps) defined by one 8bit number each, it only carries the code up to 255, which means only normal keys can be sent this way.
  - The step uses a sequence of 8bit numbers to identify any key < 256, as no flags are sent, 0 is used for the flag identifier instead.
  - Example: " 12 14 7 18 18 26 0" for the keyCode 225, which activates the tap action for the Right Shift button.
  - Total cost = N + 1, being N the number of actions to be performed in a closed while loop

then we send the actual keyCode that we can find in the [keymap database](https://github.com/Dygmalab/Bazecor/tree/development/src/api/keymap/db)

We repeat this for each action we want to perform until we finish the whole macro, then a zero is required to close the macro, afterwards we can insert more, when no more macros have to be added, end the map with a " 0 0 " to tell the plugin, no further macros are present.

#### Commands

To retrieve:

- JavaScript: `focus.command("macros.map")`
- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'macros.map' > /dev/ttyACM0`

To set:

- JavaScript: `focus.command("macros.map 8 4 8 5 8 6 0 8 7 8 8 0 0")`
- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'macros.map 8 4 8 5 8 6 0 8 7 8 8 0 0' > /dev/ttyACM0`

#### Expected output

The command allows you to remap the macros without bazecor, and to use hidden functions not currently supported by the graphical configurator. there is no need to send the whole map.

### macros.trigger

This command triggers a stored macro programatically.

#### Commands

To use:

- JavaScript: `focus.command("macros.trigger 0")`
- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'macros.trigger 0' > /dev/ttyACM0`

#### Expected output

Allows you to test any macro stored in the EEPROM without assigning it to a key

### superkeys.map

This command reads/writes the superkeys map (1024 bytes of max lenght), each action in a superkey is represented by a keyCode number that encodes the action, for example if you use the number 44, you are encoding space, etc... to know more about keycodes and to find the right one for your actions, check [keymap database](https://github.com/Dygmalab/Bazecor/tree/development/src/api/keymap/db)

The structure is composed of the encoded actions in this order

- TAP
  - Tap action which is the first tap to activate. There are certain keys that should not be sent with taps (this applies to any other tap after this one), which are:
    - modifiers
    - one-shot keys
    - other superkeys
- HOLD
  - Hold action which is the first hold to activate. There are certain keys that should not be sent with holds (this applies to any other hold after this one), which are:
    - Layer keys
    - one-shot keys
    - other superkeys
- TAP & HOLD
- DOUBLE TAP
- DOUBLE TAP & HOLD

To end a superkey, place the number of actions you want to use as keyCodes and then a zero. The zero is required to close the superkey. We can then start a new superkey or end the superkey list with a double zero " 0 0 ". This will allow the plugin to know when no further superkeys have been configured.

#### Commands

To retrieve:

- JavaScript: `focus.command("superkeys.map")`
- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'superkeys.map' > /dev/ttyACM0`

To set:

- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'superkeys.map 4 5 6 44 7 0 4 224 225 6 226 0 0' > /dev/ttyACM0`

#### Expected output

The command allows you to remap the superkeys without bazecor, and to use hidden functions not currently supported by the graphical configurator. there is no need to send the whole map.

### superkeys.waitfor

This command allows you to get/set the waitfor value of the keyboard to alter the behaviour of the superkeys.

waitfor value specifies the time between the first and subsequent releases of the HOLD actions meanwhile is held, so for example, if the variable is set to 500ms, you can mantain the hold key, it will emmit a keyCode corresponding to the action that it triggers, then it will wait for waitfor time for making another keypress with that same keycode. This enables the user to delay the hold "machinegun" to be able to release the key and achieve a single keypress from a hold action.

#### Commands

To retrieve:

- JavaScript: `focus.command("superkeys.waitfor")`
- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'superkeys.waitfor' > /dev/ttyACM0`

To set:

#### Expected output

Modifies/Retrieves the value stored in the keyboard for the waitfor timeout on the superkeys

### superkeys.timeout

This command allows you to get/set the timeout value of the keyboard to alter the behaviour of the superkeys.

timeout value specifies the time the keyboard waits after a superkey is pressed for a subsequent key press of the same superkey, in this time interval, that subsequent superkey press increases the counter of the action in the following order.

- JavaScript: `focus.command("superkeys.overlap")`
- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'superkeys.overlap' > /dev/ttyACM0`

To set:

- JavaScript: `focus.command("superkeys.overlap 80")`
- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'superkeys.overlap 80' > /dev/ttyACM0`

#### Expected output

Modifies/Retrieves the value stored in the keyboard for the overlap threshold percentage.

### hardware.flash_left_side

### hardware.flash_right_side

### hardware.verify_left_side

### hardware.verify_right_side

### Help

The help command returns all the available commands in the current version of the serial protocol, the list above is taken from this command as per version 0.2.3 of Bazecor/Raise Firmware.

#### Commands

JavaScript: `focus.command("help")`
Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'help' > /dev/ttyACM0`

#### Expected output

The output of this command is a list of all available commands including itself, this list will be ended with a nextline, period trail.

### layer.activate

This command allows the host PC to activate a certain layer remotely just by sending it's order number. The layer number will start by 0 to address the first one and will end with 9 if we suppose a 10 layer list to address the last one. This command does not affect the memory usage as the value is stored in RAM.

#### Commands

To use:

- JavaScript: `focus.command("layer.activate 1")`
- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'layer.activate 1' > /dev/ttyACM0`

#### Expected output

The layer will change inmediately according to the one sent with the command, this allows for example to use a software to recognize which app is in the foreground and switch layers accordingly if any specific layer for that software is configured.

### layer.deactivate

This command allows the host PC to deactivate the last layer that the keyboard switched to, this same function is the way the shift to layer key works on the keyboard. Just add the layer number at the end of the command to make the keyboard go back one layer. The layer number will start by 0 to address the first one and will end with 9 if we suppose a 10 layer list to address the last one.

#### Commands

To use:

- JavaScript: `focus.command("layer.deactivate")`
- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'layer.deactivate' > /dev/ttyACM0`

#### Expected output

The layer will change inmediately according to the previous one used, this allows to deactivate the layer when changing the app that is in the foreground to restore the previous layer in case no specific layer is required.

### layer.isActive

This command allows the host PC to ask the keyboard which layer is in use right now. The layer number will start by 0 to address the first one and will end with 9 if we suppose a 10 layer list to address the last one.

#### Commands

To use:

- JavaScript: `focus.command("layer.isActive")`
- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'layer.isActive' > /dev/ttyACM0`

#### Expected output

The command will return the active layer inmediately after launching it.

### layer.moveTo

This command allows the host PC to activate a certain layer remotely just by sending it's order number. The layer number will start by 0 to address the first one and will end with 9 if we suppose a 10 layer list to address the last one.

The difference between this command and the layer.activate alternative, is that the activate command adds to the layer switching history, but moveTo will erase that memory and return it to an array lenght 1 and holding the current layer the keyboard moved to.

This command does not affect the memory usage as the value is stored in RAM.

#### Commands

To use:

- JavaScript: `focus.command("layer.moveTo 1")`
- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'layer.moveTo 1' > /dev/ttyACM0`

#### Expected output

The layer will change inmediately according to the one sent with the command, this command equals the layer move from bazecor, which will permanently leave you in the new layer.

### layer.state

This command returns the isActive status for up to 32 layers. It will return a 32 number line answer with the state of each layer represented for a 0 when the layer is not active, or 1 when the layer is active.

#### Commands

To use:

- JavaScript: `focus.command("layer.state")`
- Serial Command (Unix): `echo 'layer.state' > /dev/ttyACM0`

#### Expected output

This is the typical answer when the first layer is active: "1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 "
