  // "whiteListedModules" means "modules which are bundled by webpack during
  // the build rather than treated as external". Notably, "react" requires
  // being bundled to work well in the renderer process, so electron-webpack
  // bundles it *implicitly*. That means we want all dependencies which talk to
  // react to also be bundled, since we want them to see the same instance of
  // react when they require("react") as our own (bundled) code does. Otherwise,
  // you are liable to see runtime errors like "Hooks can only be called inside
  // the body of a function component."
  //
  // Specifically, the rules of the road are:
  //  - dependencies used by the main process MUST NOT be listed/bundled
  //  - dependencies which invoke require("react") in the renderer process MUST
  //    be listed/bundled
  //  - dependencies used *only* by the renderer process which do not directly
  //    require("react") MAY be bundled
